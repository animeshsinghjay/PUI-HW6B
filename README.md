## PUI A6b Adding Functionality to a Website with JavaScript - MuddyPaws website

### Extra Credit:
  
**(1) Cool JS Functionality**    
You can update quantity (provided as a number input box) in the cart page of the website and it dynamically updates the price & total price in the cart. 

**(2) Carousel**    
I have added an auto playing (every 1.5 seconds) carousel on my home page, which can also be controlled by the left & right arrow buttons provided near it.
